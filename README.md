Spectral Clustering of the Kangaroo Rat Mating Networks

This repository contains a short script that uses simple linear algebra for spectral clustering of mating networks of the Kangaroo Rat. The script can be used for education purposes to perform spectral clustering of networks using eigenvectors step by step. 

The data used and contained in this repository was collected by Jan A. Randall as part of his study that can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00172173). I downloaded the data from [The Animal Social Structure Network Repository](https://github.com/bansallab/asnr)
